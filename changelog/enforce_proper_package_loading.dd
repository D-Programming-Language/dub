Enforce proper package loading on 'dub update'

Rather than doing `dub.loadPackage`, `enforce(loadCwdPackage...)` ensures that the package exists.
This prevents `update` code from force-creating `dub.selections.json`, and generates a proper error message.
That message is similar to one you get running `dub build` or `dub test` etc.
