copyFiles can now be used in VisualD projects.

Files that are needed for the application to run can be specified in the `copyFiles` build option,
which causes these files to be copied to the target path. The dub generator for VisualD now replicates
this behaviour, so that this kind of applications can be successfully debugged in Visual Studio.
