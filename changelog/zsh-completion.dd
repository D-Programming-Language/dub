DUB now has zsh completion

A zsh completion script is now present in `scripts/zsh-completion/_zsh`.
It can be installed under the user's prefered `fpath` and provides completion
for options for the most common `dub` commands, as well as list of packages
(based on local packages), e.g. for `dub add`.
